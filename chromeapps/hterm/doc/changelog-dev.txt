0.7.8.3, 2012-04-11, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix 'home-keys-scroll' preference.

0.7.8.2, 2012-04-11, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix google_relay.html CSP issues.

0.7.8.1, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix update_url in manifest.

0.7.8.0, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Replace 'alt-sends-escape' preference with 'alt-sends-what'.  The new pref
  can be set to 'escape', '8-bit', or 'browser-key'.  If set to 'escape' (the
  default), hterm will send ESC (as if alt-sends-escape were true, the previous
  default).  If set to '8-bit', hterm sends the unshifted character + 128 (as
  if alt-sends-escape were false).  If set to 'browser-key', hterm waits for
  the keypress event, and sends whatever character code the browser thinks best.
  On Mac, this will depend on your keyboard locale.  Composed characters
  (requiring multiple keystrokes) aren't yet implemented.  'browser-key'
  shoudn't be used in cases where Chrome uses Alt sequences for the browser.

0.7.7.1, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix crosh.html/js to work with CSP.

BUG=chromium-os:29179
TEST=Install on ChromeOS, press Ctrl-Alt-T.

0.7.7.0, 2012-04-08, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix version number.  We should have gone to 0.7.7.0 rather than 0.7.6.4 :/
* Renamed to "Secure Shell".
* Updated stable manifest to include CSP and new icons.

BUG=chromium-os:29148

0.7.6.6, 2012-04-06, rginda@chromium.org

* Update to the latest nassh binaries.

0.7.6.5, 2012-04-06, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix Ctrl-\.
* Added keyboard related preferences, 'home-keys-scroll', 'page-keys-scroll',
  'meta-sends-escape', 'backspace-sends-backspace'.
* Added altSendsEscape option to keyboard (and 'alt-sends-escape' pref).  The
  default for alt-is-meta is now false, while alt-sends-escape is true.  This
  lets Alt and Meta be distinct keys when possible (like on a Mac), while making
  Alt work "almost" like meta by default.
* Added a little platform detection logic so we don't burn BOTH Alt-1..9 and
  Meta-1..9 on every platform.
* Fixed broken backspaceSendsBackspace behavior.
* Fix Meta-Space to send ESC \x20 rather than ESC [.
* Fix character sizing issues, which solves the missing underscores in some
  fonts, and should solve partial/completely missing terminal row issues.
* Add background-image pref, defaults to a mostly transparent gradient.
* Change a few one-byte colors to work better with both light and dark
  backgrounds.

0.7.6.4, 2012-04-04, rginda@chromium.org

* Add 'manifest_version': 2 to manifest file, specify default
  Content Security Policy (CSP) policy.
* Kick off nassh initialization from nassh.js rather than
  nassh.html to make CSP happy.
* Move dialog code from terminal.* into nassh.*, makes CSP happier
  and it's the right thing to do.

BUG=chromium-os:28561

0.7.6.3, 2012-03-19, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix regression that caused hterm to fail to load if the chosen font was not
  "safe" for bold charcters.

BUG=chromium-os:28020

0.7.6.2, 2012-03-16, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix regression in terminal reset.

BUG=chromium-os:27950

0.7.6.1, 2012-03-15, rginda@chromium.org

* Make the relay code more resiliant to intermittent failures.

0.7.6.0, 2012-03-14, rginda@chromium.org

* Refactor and clean up of the relay server code.
* Add backoff logic to relay server code.
* Promote Terminal.showOverlay to Terminal.IO.showOverlay.
* PASS on handling Meta-~, since on Mac Meta is Cmd and Cmd-~ is the 'switch
  between windows of this app' sequence.

0.7.5.2, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Re-add default tab width, add a testcase to catch future regressions.

0.7.5.1, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Cached scroll-on-output and scroll-on-keystroke preferences to avoid the
  performance hit of reading a preference for each bit of output and keystroke.

0.7.5.0, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Add preferences.  Preferences are persisted to localStorage.  Active hterm
  instances will respond to preference changes by listening to the 'storage'
  event.
* Preferences can be grouped into "profiles" so that it's possible
  to maintain multiple terminal configurations and easily switch
  between them.
* The preference profile can be selected at load-time by adding
  'profile=NAME' to the url used to load nassh.html or crosh.html.

0.7.4.4, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Add ability to detect fonts with mismatched bold/normal sizes, and disable
  bold characters when that happens.

0.7.4.3, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Switch out "Andale Mono" in favor of "Menlo" in the default font family list,
  since bold characters in Andale Mono are a different width than normal
  weight characters.

0.7.4.2, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix CONNECTING message to take a single DESTINATION parameter rather
  than distinct USER and HOST parameters.  This avoids an issue in the
  chrome i18n code that chokes on the translated messages.

* Warn before closing an active crosh tab.

0.7.3.0, 2012-02-17, rginda@chromium.org

* Manifest files split into -dev and -stable versions.
* Add an altIsMeta flag, on by default.
* Treat Meta-C/Meta-Shift-V the same as Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Shift-V to
  make mac users happy.
* Pass (Ctrl|Meta)-Shift-B bookmark bar key to browser.
* Pass (Ctrl|Alt|Meta)-1/9 to the browser so as not to block
  tab switching.
* Skip pro-tip if nassh started with a known location.
* Fix TextAttributes.prototype.reset().
