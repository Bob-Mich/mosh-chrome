0.7.6.0, 2012-03-14, rginda@chromium.org

* Refactor and clean up of the relay server code.
* Add backoff logic to relay server code.
* Promote Terminal.showOverlay to Terminal.IO.showOverlay.
* PASS on handling Meta-~, since on Mac Meta is Cmd and Cmd-~ is the 'switch
  between windows of this app' sequence.

0.7.5.2, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Re-add default tab width, add a testcase to catch future regressions.

0.7.5.1, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Cached scroll-on-output and scroll-on-keystroke preferences to avoid the
  performance hit of reading a preference for each bit of output and keystroke.

0.7.5.0, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Add preferences.  Preferences are persisted to localStorage.  Active hterm
  instances will respond to preference changes by listening to the 'storage'
  event.
* Preferences can be grouped into "profiles" so that it's possible
  to maintain multiple terminal configurations and easily switch
  between them.
* The preference profile can be selected at load-time by adding
  'profile=NAME' to the url used to load nassh.html or crosh.html.

0.7.4.4, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Add ability to detect fonts with mismatched bold/normal sizes, and disable
  bold characters when that happens.

0.7.4.3, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Switch out "Andale Mono" in favor of "Menlo" in the default font family list,
  since bold characters in Andale Mono are a different width than normal
  weight characters.

0.7.4.2, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix CONNECTING message to take a single DESTINATION parameter rather
  than distinct USER and HOST parameters.  This avoids an issue in the
  chrome i18n code that chokes on the translated messages.

  tab switching.
