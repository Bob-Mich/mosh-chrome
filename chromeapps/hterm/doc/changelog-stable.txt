0.7.7, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Renamed to "Secure Shell".
* Updated stable manifest to include CSP and new icons.
* Update to the latest nassh binaries.
* Fix Ctrl-\.
* Added keyboard related preferences, 'home-keys-scroll', 'page-keys-scroll',
  'meta-sends-escape', 'backspace-sends-backspace'.
* Added altSendsEscape option to keyboard (and 'alt-sends-escape' pref).  The
  default for alt-is-meta is now false, while alt-sends-escape is true.  This
  lets Alt and Meta be distinct keys when possible (like on a Mac), while making
  Alt work "almost" like meta by default.
* Added a little platform detection logic so we don't burn BOTH Alt-1..9 and
  Meta-1..9 on every platform.
* Fixed broken backspaceSendsBackspace behavior.
* Fix Meta-Space to send ESC \x20 rather than ESC [.
* Fix character sizing issues, which solves the missing underscores in some
  fonts, and should solve partial/completely missing terminal row issues.
* Add background-image pref, defaults to a mostly transparent gradient.
* Change a few one-byte colors to work better with both light and dark
  backgrounds.
* Add 'manifest_version': 2 to manifest file, specify default
  Content Security Policy (CSP) policy.
* Kick off nassh initialization from nassh.js rather than
  nassh.html to make CSP happy.
* Move dialog code from terminal.* into nassh.*, makes CSP happier
  and it's the right thing to do.

0.7.6, 2012-03-16, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of hterm-dev-0.7.6.3
* Fix regression in bold detection. http://crosbug.com/28020
* Fix regression in terminal reset. http://crosbug.com/27950
* Refactor and clean up of the relay server code.
* Add backoff logic to relay server code.
* Promote Terminal.showOverlay to Terminal.IO.showOverlay.
* PASS on handling Meta-~, since on Mac Meta is Cmd and Cmd-~ is the 'switch
  between windows of this app' sequence.
* Add preferences.  Preferences are persisted to localStorage.  Active hterm
  instances will respond to preference changes by listening to the 'storage'
  event.
* Preferences can be grouped into "profiles" so that it's possible
  to maintain multiple terminal configurations and easily switch
  between them.
* The preference profile can be selected at load-time by adding
  'profile=NAME' to the url used to load nassh.html or crosh.html.

0.7.4, 2012-02-29, rginda@chromium.org

* Stable release of hterm-dev-0.7.4.4.
* Add ability to detect fonts with mismatched bold/normal sizes, and disable
  bold characters when that happens.
* Switch out "Andale Mono" in favor of "Menlo" in the default font family list,
  since bold characters in Andale Mono are a different width than normal
  weight characters.
* Fix CONNECTING message to take a single DESTINATION parameter rather
  than distinct USER and HOST parameters.  This avoids an issue in the
  chrome i18n code that chokes on the translated messages.

* Fix issues with ESC 0x20 handler.
* Fix permission issue in package.sh script.
* Remove spash screen.
* Warn before closing an active crosh tab.
