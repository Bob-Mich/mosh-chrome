This repository (assets.git) contains assets (images, sounds, etc.) that
are used in both official and unofficial builds.  These files are installed
by the chromeos-assets package.

The unofficial versions of assets that differ between official and
unofficial builds are stored in chromiumos-assets.git and installed by the
chromeos-assets-split package.
